# 🌈 Feel Good – A Cozy CLI Mood & Motivation Journal

**Feel Good** is a command-line journaling app that gently guides you through your emotions with warm questions, inspiring quotes, and heartwarming animal stories. It’s not just about logging your mood — it’s about softening your day and remembering you matter.

✨ Built with love using Python, SQLAlchemy, and a sprinkle of ASCII magic.

## 🌼 Why I Made This

This project started as my **Phase 3 CLI project** at Flatiron School, but it became something more meaningful — a digital sanctuary.

I wanted to build something soft, magical, and emotionally safe. Something that feels like a deep breath and a warm hug. Creating this app reminded me that technology can be tender and human, too.
